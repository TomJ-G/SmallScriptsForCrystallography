# KrystalograPy - Small Scripts For Crystallography

This is a collection of functions I use in my crystallographic work. Each function has docstring with explanation. Most functions require Crystallographic Information File (CIF) to work.

<b>Some functions are not finished yet. In such cases, I indicate this in docstring.</b>
