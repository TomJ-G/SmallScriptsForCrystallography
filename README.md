# Small Scripts For Crystallography

This is a collection of functions I use in my crystallographic work. Each function has docstring with explanation. At the moment there are two modules:  
KrystalograPy - mostly handles structural information and CIF files.   
FrameUtil     - made to read SACLA H5 images and show them in human redable form (not chopped, but assembled).  
Most functions require either CIF file or diffraction frames to work.

<b>Some functions are not finished yet. In such cases, I indicate this in docstring.</b>
